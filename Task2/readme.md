# Tic-Tac-Toe AI: Unbeatable AI with Minimax Algorithm

This repository contains an implementation of the classic game **Tic-Tac-Toe** with an AI opponent that is unbeatable. The AI uses the **Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta pruning** to make optimal decisions, ensuring that it will either win or tie, but never lose!

## How It Works

The game is played between a **human** and an **AI**. The human player uses the symbol `O`, and the AI uses the symbol `X`. The board is a 3x3 grid, and the objective is to get three of your symbols in a row, column, or diagonal.

The AI is implemented using the **Minimax algorithm** with **Alpha-Beta pruning** to optimize the decision-making process and make the AI unbeatable.

### Features

- **Unbeatable AI**: The AI uses the Minimax algorithm to ensure it either wins or ties every game.
- **Human vs AI**: A human player can play against the AI.
- **Alpha-Beta Pruning**: The Minimax algorithm is optimized using Alpha-Beta pruning for faster decision-making.
- **Terminal Interface**: The game is played in the terminal/console.

## How to Play

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/tic-tac-toe-ai.git
   cd tic-tac-toe-ai
