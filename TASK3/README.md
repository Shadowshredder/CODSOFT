- `data/items.csv`: Dataset for movies, books, and products.
- `src/collaborative_filtering.py`: Collaborative filtering model using user-item interactions.

- `main.py`: Script to run both recommendation systems.

## Setup

   ```bash
   pip install pandas scikit-learn surprise

   pip install pandas scikit-learn surprise
2. Run the recommendation system
